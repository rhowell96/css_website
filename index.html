        I reckon it's been boutta year since we adopted mischievous boi Blopberry. Matter o'fact, I reckon I gots 'bout 15 hunnid' names for the wily lil bag o' fur. Bloob, Blueberry, Blubbery, Blub, Blop, Blip-Blop, Blopberry... Just to name a few. Gosh almighty, I reckon I love him.

        I reckon there are <strong>at least a billion cats</strong> who can benefit from adoption. Probably more. To adopt a cat, <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=adopt+a+cat">simply find a participating shelter in your area</a> now.
      <!-- <h3>Future Predictions</h3>
      <p>
        I have a <strong>dream</strong>. My dream is that every cat <em>in the entire world</em> will get adopted into a loving family that will pet them, love them, and take care of their needs. Why? Because they deserve it. They're worth it.

  <h2>The Snoots</h2>
  <p>
    Cats were domesticated back in Egypt thousands of years ago. They were worshipped by the Egyptians, who built enormous monuments in their honor. This year, 2020, has been the worst year in modern history. We've also hit an all-time record low in terms of cat worship. Coincidence? No. My proposal, if I am elected president, will be to do everything in my power to make America a more cat-centered nation. They will not lead us astray.

          Blueberry is a kitten who was born on May 10, 2019. He is a very good boi and deserves all the treats in the world. His favorite treats are from Trader Joe's. <em>Fun Fact:</em> When Blueberry was still a small kitten, he loved to jump into the toilet.

          Ashberry's tale is wacky. He was born somewhere in Northern California and spent the first few years of his life in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding">hoarding</a> house. He developed feline pica, which drives him to eat plastic, cardboard, wood, and more. We still love him and give him kisses a lot.

    After using float: right or left, you might find that the website struggles to figure out where exactly the floating should end. In this case, you can use clear: right, clear: left, or clear: both to end the float instruction to your computer and make the next paragraph begin below the floating object.

  <p>
    overflow: hidden <strong>will</strong> achieve the same effect, and it's recommended that you pop an overflow command into entire wrappers (e.g. biowrappers) to ensure that all text within their bounds will cleanly break from the previous element. Keep in mind that this will cut off dropdown menus if used irresponsibly.

  <h3>Background</h3>

    Basically, overflow: hidden will hide all of the content of an element that spills out from a container of a set height. overflow: visible will allow the content that would have otherwise been cut off to flow freely across the page, regardless of height restrictions. overflow: scroll will allow the user to scroll around in a box of the defined dimensions.
